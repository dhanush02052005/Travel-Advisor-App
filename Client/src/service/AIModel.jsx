Always check current prices online before booking. I would advise using kayak, expedia, or any other aggregator to find the best deal.\n*   **Transportation:**  I've included \"timeToTravelFromHotel\" suggestions, but factor in traffic and waiting times for ride shares. Walking is often the cheapest (and sometimes fastest) option on the Strip. The monorail is useful if you are going north and south on the east side of the strip.\n*   **Food:** Las Vegas can be expensive for food. Look for off-Strip options or cheap eats within the casinos (food courts, etc.).  Happy hour deals are your friend.\n*   **Flexibility:** This is just a suggested itinerary. Feel free to adjust it based on your interests and energy levels.\n*   **Reservations:** While not always necessary for the free attractions, consider making reservations for restaurants, especially if you're going during peak season.\n*   **Check Websites:** Always check the official websites of the attractions for the most up-to-date information on hours, show schedules, and ticket prices.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings, especially at night.  Stay in well-lit areas and keep your valuables secure.\n\nThis comprehensive JSON format should give you a solid foundation for planning your budget-friendly Las Vegas getaway!  Enjoy!\n"},

This is a subjective rating on a scale of 1-5 to help prioritize based on personal preferences.\n*   **`timeTravel` Improvements:** Instead of calculating exact times, which is too variable without real-time data, I provide general methods (Bus, Ride Share, Walk, etc.) and estimated time *ranges* where appropriate (e.g., \"~30-45 minutes\").\n*   **Hotel Variety:** Provided a range of hotel options with varying price points, locations, and amenities.\n*   **More Specific Hotel Information:** Added an `\"amenities\"` list for each hotel to quickly see what's available.\n*   **Food Suggestions:**  Gave specific and budget-conscious food suggestions for each day.\n*   **Departure Notes:** Added a reminder in Day 3's notes to factor in travel time to the airport.\n*   **Clarified Costs:**  Emphasized that activities *within* a free location (like the LINQ Promenade or Container Park) might cost extra.\n*   **\"Off-Strip\" Consideration:**  The Tuscany Suites option acknowledges that sometimes going slightly off-strip can save money while still being relatively convenient.\n* **Mob Museum:** Added mob museum as one of the popular attractions in Las Vegas.\n\nThis improved JSON provides a more practical and useful travel plan for a budget-conscious couple visiting Las Vegas.  Remember to always double-check prices and schedules closer to your travel dates!\n"},
